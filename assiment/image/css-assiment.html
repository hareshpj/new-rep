    <h1>What are the benifitsbof using CCS?</h1>
    <h4>ANS: The benifits of CSS are:
        1) Faster Page Speed. More code means slower page speed. ...
        2) Better User Experience. CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly
        formatting. ...
        3) Quicker Development Time. ...
        4) Easy Formatting Changes. ...
        5) Compatibility Across Devices.
        alsoCSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element once & use
        it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.
        The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across variety of sites. One instruction can
        control several areas which is advantageous.
        Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed.
        Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies the maintenance as a change of one
        line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.
        It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.
        It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.
        CSS changes are device friendly. With people employing a batch of various range of smart devices to access
        websites over the web, there’s a requirement for responsive web design.
        It has the power for re-positioning. It helps us to determine the changes within the position of web elements
        who are there on the page.
        These bandwidth savings are substantial figures of insignificant tags that are indistinct from a mess of pages.

    <h1>What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h1>
    <h4> ANS:Disadvantages of CSS:

        CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among web browsers.
        With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for
        compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.
        There exists a scarcity of security.
        After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all
        the browsers.
        The programing language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS,
        CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.
        Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).
        CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic.
        There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS.
        There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.</h4>

    <h1>What is difference between CCS2 and CSS3?</h1>
    <h4>ANS:
        CSS3 is split into many various documents known as Modules. each module adds new capability or extends options
        outlined in CSS2 over conserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS3 started around the time of publication of
        the initial CSS2 recommendation.
        The CSS3 version supports more browsers than CSS2.
        CSS3 introduces several new selectors. Those new selectors square measure largely in an exceeding type of
        pseudo-elements and pseudo-categories.
        The new addition of General relation Combinator will be wont to match relation parts of a given part through
        diacritic (~) combinator.
        CSS3 introduces several properties attended with new values and units. It facilitates styling of backgrounds,
        borders, boxes, etc…, that permits the USA to stay most of the styling at intervals the computer network and
        HTML standards and our document, while not a necessity for all those proprietary third-party package packages.
        New values and new units square measure introduced to support all those new properties. for example, Angle units
        deg, grad, rad, and switch or Time units s and ms.

    <h1>NAME A FEW CSS STYLE COMPONENTS?</h1>
    <h4>ANS:CSS STYLE COMPONENTS ARE:
        1)Selecter:HTML element name, id name, class name.
        2)Property:It's like an attribute such as background color,font-size,position,text-align,color,border etc.

    <h1>WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY CSS OPACITY?</h1>
    <h4>ANS:
        opacity applies to the element as a whole, including its contents, even though the value is not inherited by
        child elements. Thus, the element and its children all have the same opacity relative to the element's
        background, even if they have different opacities relative to one another.

        Using opacity with a value other than 1 places the element in a new stacking context.

        To change the opacity of a background only, use the background property with a color value that allows for an
        alpha channel. For example:

        EX: background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);

    <br><br>
    <h1>HOW CAN THE BACKGROUND COLOR OF AN ELEMENT BE CHANGED?</h1>
    <h4>ANS:Default Background Color of an Element
        The default background color of a div is transparent. So if you do not specify the background-color of a div, it
        will display that of its parent element.

        Changing the Background Color of a Div
        In this example, we will change the background colors of the following divs.

        <!-- <div class="div-1"> I love HTML </div>
        <div class="div-2"> I love CSS </div>
        <div class="div-3"> I love JavaScript </div> -->
        Without any styling, this will translate to the following visually.

        Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-12.22.48-PM
        Let's change the background color of the divs by adding styles to the classes. You can follow along by trying
        the examples in an HTML file.

        <!-- <style>
            .div-1 {
                background-color: #EBEBEB;
            }
            
            .div-2 {
                background-color: #ABBAEA;
            }
            
            .div-3 {
                background-color: #FBD603;
            }
        </style>
        
        <body>
            <div class="div-1"> I love HTML </div>
            <div class="div-2"> I love CSS </div>
            <div class="div-3"> I love JavaScript </div>
        </body> -->

    <h1>HOW CAN IMAGE REPETITION OF THE BACKUP BE CONTROLLED?</h1>
    <h4>ANS:
        To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property. You can use
        no-repeat value for the background-repeat property if you do not want to repeat an image, in this case, the
        image will display only once.

    </h4>
    <br><br>
    <h1>WHAT IS THE USE OF THE BACKGROUND-POSITION PROPAERTY?</h1>
    <h4>ANS:
        The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a
        background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.
        Default value: 0% 0%
    </h4>
    <br><br>
    <h1>WHICH PROPERTY CONTROLS THE IMAGE SCROLL IN BACKGROUND?</h1>
    <h4>ANS:
        The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is
        fixed.
    </h4>
    <br><br>
    <h1>WHY SHOULD BACKGROUND AND COLOR BE USED AS SEPARATE PROPARTICE?</h1>
    <h4>ANS:
        There are two reasons behind this:

        It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is
        combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
        Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.

        An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section
        of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style
        sheet is placed within the head section of the page

    <br><br>
    <h1>WHAT ARE THE ADDVANTAGES AND DISADVANTEGES OF USEING EXTERNAL STYLE SHEET?</h1>
    <h4>ANS:
        Advantages

        1) The style of a few documents can be controlled from the site by utilizing them.
        2) Multiple HTML elements can have numerous documents, where classes can be made.
        3) To assemble styles in complex circumstances, selector and grouping strategies are utilized.

        Disadvantages

        1) The additional download is expected to import documents having style information.
        2) To render the documents, the outer template ought to be stacked.
        3) Not practical for small style definitions.
